I'm a self proclaimed information security nerd (see: CISO) working in London, my GitHub hosts some of my prouder creations, so I am grateful for your curiousity. In the future I hope to have a range of documentation and tutorials here surrounding my favourite open source application technologies that I'm most familiar with. These include, but are not limited to:

 - Typescript üëÅÔ∏è
 - Kubernetes ‚ò∏ 
 - Tailwind üí®
 - GCP üß†
 - Next.js ‚ö°

 If you are also excited by such technologies, then my repositories here may be of interest to you, but if you would like to know a bit more about me:

My main passions lie in the realms of using the vast array of free and accessible technologies made available to us to empower our own capabilities, both technically and practically. Project Y is a dream I have to be able to to enumerate on any well-enough-composed idea and generate an ephemeral system based on those demands, but that is a dream far in the future. For now, there are many other projects I'm a part of that I would love to talk about, Halo, WYA, The Buddy Project, etc, you know who you are!
