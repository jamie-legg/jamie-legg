I'm a self proclaimed information security nerd working in London. My passion is based in intelligence gathering, and my experience and side projects speak to that. Some of my personally notable work includes:
 
 - [OSINTUI](https://osintui.com) - An attack surface vector mapping tool]
 - Jamie's Lounge - A tech-enabled community to monitor and predict progress in various fields. (Down for maintenance)
 - [Project Y](https://github.com/jamie-legg/projecty) - My personal answer to the cries for open source, visually purified social media. (Under construction)

My GitHub hosts some of my prouder creations, so I am grateful for your curiousity. In the future I hope to have a range of documentation and tutorials here surrounding my favourite open source application technologies that I'm most familiar with. These include, but are not limited to:

 - Typescript üëÅÔ∏è
 - Kubernetes ‚ò∏ 
 - Tailwind üí®
 - GCP üß†
 - Next.js ‚ö°

 If you are also excited by such technologies, then my repositories here may be of interest to you, but if you would like to know a bit more about me:

My main passions lie in the realms of using the vast array of free and accessible technologies made available to us to empower our own capabilities, both technically and practically. Project Y is a dream I have to be able to to enumerate on any well-enough-composed idea and generate an ephemeral system based on those demands, but that is a dream far in the future. For now, there are many other projects I'm a part of that I would love to talk about, Halo, WYA, The Buddy Project, etc, you know who you are!
